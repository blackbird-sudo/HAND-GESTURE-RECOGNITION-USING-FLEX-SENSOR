# HAND-GESTURE-RECOGNITION-USING-FLEX-SENSOR
Speech-impaired people can only communicate through sign language. Normal people will find it  challenging because they can't understand sign language. To solve the issue, this project has put  into operation a model that will contribute to closing the communication gap between the mute  and the rest of society.
